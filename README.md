This game is just made to learn a little bit of reactjs. There is multiple flaws that I have no time to fix at this moment but the core game works.

Download the zipfil and then open the folder in your IDE (Visual studio code).
Open a new terminal and write npm install once that is done you write npm start and the program will run.

ONLY THE "Go to game start" works as of right now! The history function isn't fixed and will throw an error.
